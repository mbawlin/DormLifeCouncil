Situation:

You have been hired by the UCMerced Dorm Life Council to prepare a program which measures compatibility between potential roommates. You are given a file with the list of students. For each student, you are given their name, gender and birthday. You will also have their preference for quiet time, music, reading and chatting. Using this information, you can then determine the compatibility between two people for rooming together, according to a formula developed by the Dorm Life Council.

End situation

This program pulls data from text files and iterates through every student to deem who would match best with each other using different instance variables.
